## ✅ Verification After Cleanup

All of these should work without the deleted files:

- [ ] Admin login page loads
- [ ] Dashboard shows registrations
- [ ] Can filter and search registrations
- [ ] Can update student status
- [ ] Can manage registered students
- [ ] Can view payment information
- [ ] Can print payment reports
- [ ] Course planning works
- [ ] Public registration form works
- [ ] Contact form works
- [ ] Emails send correctly
- [ ] No 404 errors
- [ ] All navigation links work

---

**Note**: This is a conservative approach. All recommendations are based on dead code analysis - nothing actively used is being deleted.
