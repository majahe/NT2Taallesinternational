### SECTION 2: Unnecessary Components (DELETE ❌)

#### 2.1 LMS Student Portal - ENTIRELY UNUSED

**Directory**: `student/` (11 files, ~3,000 lines)

```
❌ student/auth/login.php
   Purpose: Student portal login
   Status: Orphaned - no users, no course data
   Depends on: student_enrollments table (always empty)
   Impact: NONE if deleted
   
❌ student/auth/logout.php
❌ student/auth/register_password.php (Sets student password)

❌ student/course/view_course.php    (View courses)
❌ student/course/view_lesson.php    (View lessons)
❌ student/course/assignment.php     (View assignments)
❌ student/course/submit_assignment.php (Submit work)
❌ student/course/assignment_result.php (View results)

❌ student/dashboard/dashboard.php   (Student home page)
❌ student/dashboard/my_courses.php  (Enrolled courses)

❌ student/progress/my_progress.py   (Progress tracking)
```

**Why It's Dead Code**:
- Admin has NO UI to create courses
- No mechanism to populate courses table
- No mechanism to enroll students
- `grant_course_access.php` tries to use this but it's disconnected
- Database queries will return empty results
- No links pointing to this portal anywhere in system

**Cleanup Impact**: -3,000 lines, easier maintenance, no functionality loss

---

#### 2.2 Admin Course Management - BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE

**Directory**: `admin/courses/` (5 files, ~1,500 lines)

```

❌ admin/courses/edit_lesson.php          (Lesson editor)
❌ admin/courses/upload_video.php         (Video upload)
❌ admin/courses/manual_upload.php        (Manual upload)
```

**Why It's Dead Code**:
- No navigation links to these pages in admin dashboard
- Not accessible from any admin menu
- Creates data that isn't used anywhere
- Student portal that would use this is also dead code
- You don't offer online courses (registration suggests in-person)

**Cleanup Impact**: -1,500 lines, no functionality loss

---

#### 2.3 Admin Assignment Management - NEVER CONNECTED

**Directory**: `admin/assignments/` (4 files, ~2,500 lines)

```

❌ admin/assignments/create_assignment.php  (Assignment creator)
❌ admin/assignments/edit_assignment.php    (Assignment editor)
❌ admin/assignments/view_submissions.php   (View submissions)
```

**Why It's Dead Code**:
- Extremely complex: 630+ lines with question systems
- Expected to work with student portal (also dead)
- Student enrollment required (system never enrolls students)
- No UI to access from admin dashboard
- Database tables exist but are always empty

**Cleanup Impact**: -2,500 lines, no functionality loss

---

#### 2.4 Debug Folder - 🔴 SECURITY CRITICAL

**Directory**: `admin/debug/` (8 files, ~1,200 lines)

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: SQL Injection in Admin Dashboard

**File**: `admin/dashboard/dashboard.php` (Line 22)

```php
// ❌ VULNERABLE
if (isset($_POST['update_status'])) {
  $id = intval($_POST['id']);
  $status = $_POST['status'];  // NO VALIDATION!
  $conn->query("UPDATE registrations SET status='$status' WHERE id=$id");
  echo "OK";
  exit;
}
```

**Exploit Example**:
```
status = "', password='hacked' WHERE username='admin' #"
```

**Fix**: Use prepared statements (already done in some files)

```php
// ✅ SECURE
$stmt = $conn->prepare("UPDATE registrations SET status = ? WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("si", $status, $id);
$stmt->execute();
```

---

### Issue #2: Hardcoded Credentials Exposed

**File**: `includes/config.php`

```php
// ❌ EXPOSED IN VERSION CONTROL
define('DB_PASS', 'STRSQL!@Maarten62#$');
define('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'wybs joes ngev yxbw');
```

**Risk**: Anyone with Git access can see production credentials

**Fix**: Move to `.env` file, add to `.gitignore`

---

### Issue #3: Debug Password Reset Tool Accessible

**File**: `admin/debug/fix_password.php`

```php
// ❌ MAJOR SECURITY RISK
// Anyone knowing URL can reset admin password!
$sql = "UPDATE admins SET password=SHA2('mjh123', 256)...";
```

**Fix**: Delete entire `admin/debug/` folder

---

### Issue #4: Inconsistent Password Hashing

**Issues Found**:
- Some code uses SHA2
- Some code uses PASSWORD_DEFAULT (correct)
- Some code doesn't hash passwords at all

**Standardization Needed**: Use `password_hash()` everywhere

---

### Issue #5: Missing Input Validation

**Example**: Contact form and registration form missing comprehensive validation

**Issues**:
- No sanitization of text fields
- No phone number validation
- No length checks on text
- No XSS protection (missing htmlspecialchars)

---

```

---

## ⚠️ What NOT to Delete

### Core Business Logic (NEVER DELETE)
✅ `index.php` - Homepage  
✅ `admin/auth/` - Login system  
✅ `admin/dashboard/` - Main dashboard  
✅ `admin/students/` - Student management  
✅ `admin/payments/` - Payment tracking  
✅ `admin/planning/` - Course planning  
✅ `handlers/submit_registration.php` - Registration form  
✅ `handlers/submit_contact.php` - Contact form  
✅ `includes/` - All configuration  
✅ `assets/` - All styling and images  
✅ `pages/` - Public pages  

---

## 📝 Database Table Audit

### Active Tables (Used)
```sql
✅ admins               - Admin accounts
✅ registrations        - Student registrations + payments
✅ contact_messages     - Contact form submissions
```

### Inactive Tables (Never Used)
```sql
❌ courses              - No UI to populate, always empty
❌ course_modules       - Depends on courses, empty
❌ lessons              - Depends on modules, empty
❌ assignments          - Complex system, never used
❌ assignment_questions - For assignments, empty
❌ student_enrollments  - For LMS portal, empty
❌ student_progress     - For progress tracking, empty
❌ student_assignments  - For submissions, empty
```

**Recommendation**: Keep tables for now (easy to restore), focus on removing PHP code

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Architectural Divergence**: Started as one system, evolved into two separate flows
2. **Incomplete Feature**: Someone built a full LMS but it was never connected
3. **Good Business Logic**: Your actual registration system is clean and works well
4. **Time to Clean**: 40 hours of development = 6-8 hours of cleanup
5. **Prevention**: Document which features are "in progress" vs "complete"

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement Phase 1-2 (security + broken files)
2. **Week 2**: Implement Phase 3 (dead code removal)
3. **Week 3**: Implement Phase 4-5 (documentation + quality fixes)
4. **Week 4**: Testing and final verification

---

**Recommendation**: Start with Phase 1 (security) immediately, then work through phases based on priority and available time.
